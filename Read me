## Description

This project is a basic solar system simulator that uses Python and Matplotlib to visualize the motion of planets around the Sun. It provides a simple, educational, and interactive way to explore planetary orbits in our solar system.

## Features

- Visualize the motion of planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) around the Sun.
- Interactive animation that shows the orbits over a specified number of years.
- Customizable simulation parameters such as the time span and time step.
- Educational tool for learning about planetary motion and orbits.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-system-simulator.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the simulation script:

   ```bash
   python solar_system_simulator.py
   ```

2. Adjust the simulation parameters as needed, such as the time span and time step.

3. Observe the animation of the solar system.

## Simulation Details

- The simulation uses a basic Euler method for numerical integration and doesn't consider gravitational interactions between planets.
- Planetary positions and velocities are calculated based on the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and period of each planet's orbit.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, please open an issue or create a pull request.
